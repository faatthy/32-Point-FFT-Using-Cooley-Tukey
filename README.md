![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7025bf-4a2c-4852-878a-779681c741ef)

## Algorithm
- Uses radix-2 DIT FFT with 5 stages (since log‚ÇÇ(32) = 5).
- Each stage uses butterfly units for complex arithmetic.
- Time-sharing is employed with **16 butterfly units**, reused over 5 cycles.

## Processing Unit
- Core unit is the **butterfly**, which performs complex multiplications and additions.
- A single-stage, time-multiplexed architecture is used to **save area**.

## Fixed-Point Analysis
- Input is **8-bit fixed-point (S(7,0))**.
- Twiddle factors and output formats tested for optimal **SQNR (Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio)**.
- **Chosen butterfly output format**: **S(12,0)** for a balance of precision and hardware simplicity.

- Control unit (counter-based)

## Clocking
- Operates at **100 MHz**, with I/O operating effectively at **20 MHz**  
- Uses **enable signals** instead of separate clock domains
